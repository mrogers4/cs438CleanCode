Quick Start:
To Build: Run make
To Run: Execute at command line "java MazeSearch"

Details:
I am given a maze and I have to maneuver my way through it by using recursion. I had my input look on all sides of where I was and place a number 7 where there was a 1 and not a dead end. Eventually it would go through the whole maze until it had a way to get out of the Maze with all 7's.
